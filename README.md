# AirPodsUI
AirPods pop up and animation for Windows!

## What's this?
This adds the AirPods pop up from iOS and (new) the pill looking pop up from iOS 14!

## Features?
Apart from adding the pop up and the Apple Pencil looking pop up, this has many more customization options:

- Change background and foreground color
- Custom device name text or button text
- Custom animation/image/icon
- Multiple devices
- USB support
- And more (putting this here in case i missed something)

## ETA?
Soon, I don't have a exact release as I plan to rewrite the old one (yes again) for a couple of reasons:
1. I lost the source code for the old version before I was able to commit (i learned from my mistakes now lol)
2. I want to add a new UI which would not be possible on the old one.
